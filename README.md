## Hey ðŸ‘‹, This is Justin Owens
 I had always believed that my path lay in the realm of technology. Little did I know that within this vibrant sphere, I would discover a surprising love for working with data. It was an unexpected twist that ignited an insatiable curiosity within me.
After Working as a Microsoft Partner during my time with Vitalyst doing a lot of VLOOKUP's and Pivot Tables in Excel this experience made me realize the power of data and the significant impact it can have on businesses and processes. Motivated by this realization, I made the decision to transition into becoming a data specialist.


While pursuing a college degree was not a feasible option for me at the time, I sought out a practical alternative to acquire the necessary skills. Thatâ€™s when I discovered the TripleTen Business Intelligence program, a bootcamp that perfectly aligned with my aspirations.
During the program, I delved deep into the realms of SQL , Tableau and Power BI. Collaborating with fellow students on over 10 study projects, we tackled real-world business cases, utilizing data to drive improvements and achieve tangible results. You can learn more about my past projects on my GitHub page. Now equipped with proficient skills in big data analysis and visualization, I am eager to apply my expertise within the media & communications industry, with a focus on driving growth and boosting sales.

Please feel free to connect with me here on GitHub or via email at Jjgowens@yahoo.com. If you happen to know of any data analyst positions that align with my interests and skills, I would greatly appreciate your recommendations. I'm excited to explore new opportunities and contribute to the success of forward-thinking organizations.
